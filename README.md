# CodeChallenges

1- C#
You are given two arbitrarily large numbers stored one digit at a time in an array.
The first must be added to the second and the second must be reversed before addition.
The goal is to calculate the sum of those two sets of values.

2- SQL

A Customer Table with FirstName, LastName, Age, Occupation, MartialStatus, PersonID
